# C
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs and is known for its efficiency, portability, and close relationship with hardware. C is widely used for system programming, including operating systems, embedded systems, and game development. 
# [[Python]]
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\))

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the industry. It's widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, and scripting.
It can be used to automate repetitive tasks and create sophisticated applications; it can also be used in penetration testing.
Characterisitics:
- **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line, which simplifies debugging and testing. 
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports object-oriented programming principles like classes and objects, promoting modularity and reusability. 
- **High-Level:** Python abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their programs. 
- **Dynamically Typed:** Python determines the data type of a variable at runtime, offering flexibility. 
- **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a vast collection of pre-built modules and packages, providing functionalities for various tasks. 
- **Cross-Platform:** Python runs on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
- **Extensible:** Python can be extended with code written in other languages like C or C++.
