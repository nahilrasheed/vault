Bug bounty programs enable security researchers and penetration testers to get recognition (and often monetary compensation) for finding vulnerabilities in websites, applications, or any other types of systems. 
Companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco and even government institutions such as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) use bug bounty programs to reward security professionals when they find vulnerabilities in their systems. Many security companies, such as HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and SynAck, provide platforms for businesses and security professionals to participate in bug bounty programs. These programs are different from traditional penetration testing engagements but have a similar goal: finding security vulnerabilities to allow the organization to fix them before malicious attackers are able to exploit such vulnerabilities.
