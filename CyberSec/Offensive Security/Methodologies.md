### MITRE ATT&CK  
The MITRE ATT&CK framework ([_https://attack.mitre.org_](https://attack.mitre.org/)) is an amazing resource for learning about an adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Both offensive security professionals (penetration testers, red teamers, bug hunters, and so on) and incident responders and threat hunting teams use the MITRE ATT&CK framework today. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a collection of different matrices of tactics, techniques, and subtechniques. These matrices–including the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix, Network, Cloud, ICS, and Mobile–list the tactics and techniques that adversaries use while preparing for an attack, including gathering of information (open-source intelligence [OSINT], technical and people weakness identification, and more) as well as different exploitation and post-exploitation techniques. 
### OWASP WSTG  
The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) is a comprehensive guide focused on web application testing. It is a compilation of many years of work by OWASP members. OWASP WSTG covers the high-level phases of web application security testing and digs deeper into the testing methods used. For instance, it goes as far as providing attack vectors for testing cross-site scripting (XSS), XML external entity (XXE) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection attacks; as well as how to prevent and mitigate these attacks. You will learn more about these attacks in Module 6, “Exploiting Application-Based Vulnerabilities.” From a web application security testing perspective, OWASP WSTG is the most detailed and comprehensive guide available. You can find the OWASP WSTG and related project information at [_https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/_](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/).
### NIST SP 800-115
Special Publication (SP) 800-115 is a document created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST SP 800-115 provides organizations with guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing. It superseded the previous standard document, SP 800-42. SP 800-115 is considered an industry standard for penetration testing guidance and is called out in many other industry standards and documents. You can access NIST SP 800-115 at [_https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final_](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final).
### OSSTMM  
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), developed by Pete Herzog, has been around a long time. Distributed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM), the OSSTMM is a document that lays out repeatable and consistent security testing ([_https://www.isecom.org_](https://www.isecom.org/)). It is currently in version 3, and version 4 is in draft status. The OSSTMM has the following key sections:
- Operational Security Metrics
- Trust Analysis
- Work Flow
- Human Security Testing
- Physical Security Testing
- Wireless Security Testing
- Telecommunications Security Testing
- Data Networks Security Testing
- Compliance Regulations
- Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)
### PTES
The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) ([_http://www.pentest-standard.org_](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)) provides information about types of attacks and methods, and it provides information on the latest tools available to accomplish the testing methods outlined. PTES involves seven distinct phases:
1. Pre-engagement interactions
2. Intelligence gathering
3. Threat modeling
4. Vulnerability analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-exploitation
7. Reporting
### ISSAF
The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is another penetration testing methodology similar to the others on this list with some additional phases. ISSAF covers the following phases:
- Information gathering
- Network mapping
- Vulnerability identification
- Penetration
- Gaining access and privilege escalation
- Enumerating further
- Compromising remote users/sites
- Maintaining access
- Covering the tracks
