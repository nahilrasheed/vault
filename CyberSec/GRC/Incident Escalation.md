## Incident escalation
Security incident escalation is the process of identifying a potential security incident. During this process, potential incidents are transferred to a more experienced department or team member. As a security analyst, you’ll be expected to recognize potential issues, such as when an employee excessively enters the wrong credentials to their account, and report it to the appropriate person. When you join a new organization, you’ll learn about the specific processes and procedures for escalating incidents.
## Notification of breaches
Many countries have breach notification laws, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the laws applicable in the area your company is operating in. Breach notification laws require companies and government entities to notify individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII). PII includes personal identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, etc.), medical records, addresses, and other sensitive customer information.

## Escalation Policy
Aset of actions that outline who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled


Roles of the various team members who are a part of the incident escalation process.
## Data owners
A data owner is the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, access, and use of company data. For example, consider a situation where an employee gains unauthorized access to software they do not need to use for work. This kind of security event would be escalated to the data owner of that software.

## Data controllers
Data controllers determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. This role largely focuses on collecting the personal information of customers. The data controller determines how that data is used. The data controller also ensures that data is used, stored, and processed in accordance with relevant security and privacy regulations. If sensitive customer information was at risk, that event would be escalated to data controllers.

## Data processors
Data processors report directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is typically a vendor and is often tasked with installing security measures to help protect the data. Data processing issues are typically escalated to the individual who oversees the third-party organization responsible for data processing.

## Data custodians
Data custodians assign and remove access to software or hardware. Custodians are responsible for implementing security controls for the data they are responsible for, granting and revoking access to that data, creating policies regarding how that data is stored and transmitted, advising on potential threats to that data, and monitoring the data. Data custodians are notified when data security controls need to be strengthened or have been compromised.

## Data protection officers (DPOs)
Data protection officers are responsible for monitoring the internal compliance of an organization’s data protection procedures. These individuals advise the security team on the obligations required by the organization's data protection standards and procedures. They also conduct assessments to determine whether or not the security measures in place are properly protecting the data as necessary. DPOs are notified when set standards or protocols have been violated.


## Stakeholders
A **stakeholder** is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization. A big part of what you’ll do as a security analyst is report your findings to various security stakeholders. 

## Levels of stakeholders 

There are many levels of stakeholders within larger organizations. As an entry-level analyst, you might only communicate directly with a few of them. Although you might not communicate with all of the security stakeholders in an organization, it’s important to have an understanding of who key stakeholders are:

- A cybersecurity risk manager is a professional responsible for leading efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within an organization.
- A Chief Executive Officer, also known as the CEO, is the highest ranking person in an organization. You are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst.
- A Chief Financial Officer, also known as the CFO, is another high-level stakeholder that you’re unlikely to communicate with directly.
- A Chief Information Security Officer, also known as the CISO, is the highest level of security stakeholder. You are also unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst. 
- An operations manager oversees the day-to-day security operations. These individuals lead teams related to the development and implementation of security strategies that protect an organization from cyber threats.
- The legal counsel tracks applicable litigation and provides legal advice to the organization. To track litigation, they follow new and changing security legislation and regulations. They may also help address loss of secured data, legal penalties, and regulatory fines.
