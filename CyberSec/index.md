## *Cybersecurity (or security)* 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.
### Key terms and concepts
- **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
- **Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. ^696cbb
- **Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
- **Security posture** is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
- A **threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
- An **internal threat** can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor _intentionally_ engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
- **Network security** is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.
- **Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
- **Personally identifiable information (PII):** Any information used to infer an individual’s identity
- **Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII):** A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

## Ethics in cybersecurity
Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.
## Cybersecurity tools
- [[SIEM]] Tools
- Network Protocol Analyzer / Packet sniffer: a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Common network protocol analyzers include tcpdump and Wireshark.
- [[SQL]] stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
- An **intrusion detection system** (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.

- **Encryption** is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. **Cryptographic encoding** means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. **Plaintext** is unencrypted information and **secure ciphertext** is the result of encryption.
