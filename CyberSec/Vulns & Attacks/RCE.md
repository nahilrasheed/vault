An RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely run malicious code on a target's computer or server. This is one of the most dangerous types of cyberattacks because it can give the attacker complete control over the compromised system without needing any prior access.

How RCE works:

1. **Vulnerability identification**: The attacker finds a flaw in an application, network service, or operating system. Common vulnerabilities that can lead to RCE include injection attacks (like SQL injection) and insecure deserialization.
2. **Payload delivery**: The attacker crafts and sends a malicious payload, often disguised as legitimate input or traffic, to the vulnerable system over a network.
3. **Code execution**: The vulnerable system processes the malicious payload and executes the attacker's code. At this point, the attacker can gain unauthorized access and control.
