## CIA triad 
CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
It is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. For example, strict access controls that define who should and should not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe.
- Integrity means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from being tampered with.
- Availability means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
